Roughly speaking, a query vector for a token represents \"what I am looking for\" and a key vector represents \"what information I contain.\" The weight at which a token attends to another token is determined by the dot product of the query vector of the attending token and the key vector of the other token. There is also a value vector which is also obtained by forwarding through another linear layer. The value vector can be interpreted as information that is communicated (whereas the information of the original vector can be thought of as private). "

    "### Notes about attention:\n",
    "- What does self-attention mean? Keys, queries, values all come from the same vector `x`, so it attends to itself. If the source of the key and value vectors and the source of the query vector differs, it is known as cross-attention. \n",
    "- Attention is a communication mechanism. Think of each token as a node in a directed graph, in which each node has some information and can aggregate information from all nodes that point to it. In self-attention, each node only points to future tokens, but there is no constraint on the connectivity of the graph.\n",
    "- There is no concept of space or ordering in attention by default. In order to provide spatial information, we use positional encoding embeddings (found in `v2.py`).\n",
    "- Encoder vs Decoder\n",
    "  - Encoder block: allow all the nodes to talk to each other (e.g. sentiment analysis)\n",
    "  - Decoder block: only allow node to attend to previous nodes (e.g. next token prediction)\n",
    "- \"Scaled attention\": divide wei by $\\sqrt {d_k}$ where $d_k$ is the head size. This is so that `wei` has variance of 1 and is evenly diffused. `wei` feeds into softmax, and softmax produces peaky vectors (similar to a one-hot where one value is really large and the others are low) for large inputs, so we want to keep the values in wei under a constrained variance, especially at initialization.\n",
    "- Self-attention allows tokens within the input to talk to each other. Usually a linear layer is placed immediately after an attention layer to give the tokens time to process the information from attention."
