# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero
This repository contains my re-implementations of the code in Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=1).

- `micrograd`: scalar-level autograd engine
- `makemore`: character-level language model that "makes more of the input" (implemented using various models)
- `nanogpt`: similar to `makemore`, but uses a GPT-like architecture (stacked decoders)
- `minbpe`: BPE tokenizer that supports training and inference
